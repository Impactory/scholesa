## CURRENT VERDICT: NOT GOLD-READY

**Verified**: 6 of 10 workflows (WF2, WF3, WF5, WF7, WF8, WF9)
**Partial**: 4 of 10 workflows (WF1, WF4, WF6, WF10)
**Active blockers**: 4 (G9–G12)

## GOLD-READY WORKFLOW VERIFICATION

### WF1. Curriculum admin can define capabilities and map them to units/checkpoints

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL — Capability CRUD works, checkpoint mapping admin UI missing

**What's verified**:
- ✅ `CapabilityFrameworkEditor.tsx` — Full CRUD for capabilities: title, pillar (FUTURE_SKILLS/LEADERSHIP_AGENCY/IMPACT_INNOVATION), descriptor, sortOrder
- ✅ Progression descriptors — 4 text fields (beginning/developing/proficient/advanced) saved to `progressionDescriptors` object on capability doc
- ✅ Unit/mission mapping — Checkbox list of missions via `unitMappings: string[]` array storing mission IDs
- ✅ Rubric template creation — Criteria mapped to capabilities with `maxScore` and optional descriptors
- ✅ Firestore persistence — `addDoc(capabilitiesCollection)` / `updateDoc()` site-scoped, `isHQ()` gated writes
- ✅ `useCapabilities` hook loads and caches capabilities per-site

**What's missing**:
- ❌ **G9: No checkpoint mapping admin UI** — The `checkpointMappings` field exists in backend data (functions `getParentDashboardBundle` uses `checkpointMappingsFromUnknown()` to parse it from portfolio items and growth events), but there is NO admin authoring UI in `CapabilityFrameworkEditor` to define which checkpoints map to which capabilities. Checkpoint mappings are only populated downstream when evidence is reviewed — they are not part of curriculum-level authoring.
- ❌ Unit mappings have no referential integrity — `unitMappings: string[]` stores mission IDs without foreign-key validation. Orphaned IDs possible.

**Blocker**: G9 — Checkpoint mapping authoring (see §BLOCKERS below)

---

### WF2. Teacher can run a session and quickly log capability observations during build time

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- `EducatorEvidenceCapture.tsx` — Single-column form: session selector (today's sessions pre-queried), learner selector, phase selector (retrieval_warm_up / mini_lesson / build_sprint / checkpoint / share_out / reflection), description, capability selector, portfolio-candidate toggle
- Retains learner + session context across multiple entries (only clears description/capability/phase on submit)
- `addDoc(evidenceRecordsCollection)` with full provenance: `learnerId`, `educatorId`, `siteId`, `sessionOccurrenceId`, `capabilityId`, `phaseKey`, `portfolioCandidate`, `rubricStatus: 'pending'`, `growthStatus: 'pending'`
- Under 10 seconds per entry: 1 dropdown + 1 phase + 1 text + 1 button, no modal
- Session context from `sessionOccurrences` query joined with parent session docs
- `EvidenceRecord` schema: `schema.ts:1185-1203`

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF3. Student can submit artifacts, reflections, and checkpoint evidence

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- **Artifact submission** — `LearnerEvidenceSubmission.tsx` artifact tab: title, description, URL, capability IDs, AI disclosure (used + details). Creates `PortfolioItem` with `source: 'learner_submission'`, `verificationStatus: 'pending'`, `aiDisclosureStatus`, `capabilityIds`, `pillarCodes`
- **Reflection submission** — Creates TWO docs: `PortfolioItem` with `source: 'reflection'` AND `LearnerReflection` with `portfolioItemId` cross-link (G1 fix)
- **Checkpoint submission** — Creates TWO docs: `MissionAttempt` then `PortfolioItem` with `missionAttemptId: attemptRef.id` (G2 fix)
- All three types write real Firestore docs with `siteId`, `learnerId`, AI disclosure fields

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF4. Teacher can apply a 4-level rubric tied to capabilities and process domains

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL — 4-level capability rubric works, process domains not implemented

**What's verified**:
- ✅ `RubricReviewPanel.tsx` — Loads published `rubricTemplates` from Firestore, template selector dropdown, populates criteria scores from template
- ✅ 4-level scoring: `SCORE_LEVELS` = 1=Beginning, 2=Developing, 3=Proficient, 4=Advanced
- ✅ `getDescriptor()` retrieves level-specific progression descriptor text from template
- ✅ `applyRubricToEvidence` callable (functions `index.ts:~8051-8150`): atomically creates `RubricApplication`, `CapabilityGrowthEvent` per capability, upserts `CapabilityMastery` with `latestLevel`/`highestLevel`
- ✅ `rubricId` passed to callable (G3 fix)
- ✅ `RubricTemplateCriterion` has `capabilityId`, `pillarCode`, `maxScore`, optional `descriptors`

**What's missing**:
- ❌ **G10: No process domain concept** — The gold spec requires rubrics "tied to capabilities **and** process domains" (e.g., collaboration, critical thinking, communication, persistence). There is ZERO implementation of process domains:
  - No `ProcessDomain` type in schema
  - No process domain field in `RubricTemplateCriterion` (only `capabilityId`)
  - No process domain selector in rubric review UI
  - No process domain scoring in `applyRubricToEvidence` callable
  - No process domain display in portfolio, passport, or growth events
- This means rubrics only score subject-area capabilities, not cross-cutting skills

**Blocker**: G10 — Process domain model (see §BLOCKERS below)

---

### WF5. Proof-of-learning can be captured and reviewed

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- `ProofOfLearningVerification.tsx` — 3 verification methods: explainItBack ("Can the learner explain the concept in their own words?"), oralCheck ("Can the learner answer follow-up questions?"), miniRebuild ("Can the learner recreate or extend the work independently?")
- Educator sees original evidence: title, description, capability count, evidence record count, artifact count, capabilities mapped (pill badges), AI disclosure detail
- Checkboxes for each proof check with conditional textareas for excerpts, educator notes field
- Two submit paths: "Verify" (needs ≥2 checks) and "Mark reviewed" (no requirement)
- `verifyProofOfLearning` callable (`index.ts:~8249-8320`): updates `PortfolioItem` with `verificationStatus`/`proofOfLearningStatus`/proof excerpts, creates `CapabilityGrowthEvent` with `source: 'proof_of_learning'`, upserts `CapabilityMastery`
- Atomic batch commit

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF6. Capability growth updates over time from evidence

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL — Backend growth engine works, web growth dashboard missing

**What's verified**:
- ✅ `applyRubricToEvidence` callable creates `capabilityGrowthEvents` with: `level` (1-4), `rawScore`, `maxScore`, `linkedEvidenceRecordIds`, `linkedPortfolioItemIds`, `rubricApplicationId`, `educatorId`, `createdAt`
- ✅ `verifyProofOfLearning` callable creates `capabilityGrowthEvent` with `source: 'proof_of_learning'`, `level = checkpointCount` (1-3)
- ✅ Both callables upsert `capabilityMastery` with `latestLevel`, `highestLevel`, `evidenceIds[]`, `growthEventIds[]`
- ✅ Growth events are append-only, queryable by `learnerId` + `createdAt`
- ✅ `LearnerPassportExport.tsx` renders growth timeline (15 most recent): capability title, level, educator name, rubric scores
- ✅ `CapabilityGuidancePanel.tsx` shows per-pillar average level + band (strong/developing/emerging)
- ✅ Flutter has custom growth visualizations in `parent_summary_page.dart` (level progression bars per capability)

**What's missing**:
- ❌ **G11: Web `/learner/today` shows session list, not growth dashboard** — Route uses `loadLearnerToday()` which queries enrollments → sessions and returns `WorkflowRecord[]` (title/subtitle/status). Learner CANNOT see "my capability growth this week" or "what I'm improving at." The backend data exists but the web UI is a generic CRUD list.
- ❌ No web-side growth trajectory view (only in passport and Flutter)

**Blocker**: G11 — Custom learner dashboard (see §BLOCKERS below)

---

### WF7. Student portfolio shows real artifacts and reflections

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- `LearnerPortfolioBrowser.tsx` — Queries `portfolioItems` where `learnerId` == current user, `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- Shows: title, source badge (artifact/reflection/checkpoint), description, verification status badge (pending→yellow, reviewed→blue, verified→green), PoL badge, capability tags (resolved via `useCapabilities`), file count, AI assistance indicator, growth links, proof bundle indicator
- Filters: source type (all/artifact/reflection/checkpoint), verification status (all/pending/reviewed/verified), pillar (all/FUTURE_SKILLS/LEADERSHIP_AGENCY/IMPACT_INNOVATION)
- Tabbed layout on `/learner/portfolio`: "My Portfolio" (browser, default) + "Submit Evidence" (submission form)

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF8. Ideation Passport/report can be generated from actual evidence

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- `LearnerPassportExport.tsx` calls `getParentDashboardBundle` callable with `{ siteId, locale, range: 'all' }`
- Callable aggregates: `capabilityMastery`, `capabilityGrowthEvents`, `portfolioItems`, `evidenceRecords`, `missionAttempts`, `learnerReflections` (+ more)
- Per-capability claims: `evidenceCount`, `verifiedArtifactCount`, `proofOfLearningStatus`, `rubricRawScore`/`rubricMaxScore`, `progressionDescriptors`, `aiDisclosureStatus`, `reviewingEducatorName`, `reviewedAt`
- Capability band calculation: normalized per-pillar score → strong/developing/emerging band
- Growth timeline rendered: up to 15 events with capability title, level, date, educator name, rubric score
- Export: text export (`handleExportText`) + browser print/PDF (`handlePrint`)
- Honest empty state: "No capability claims backed by evidence yet"
- ⚠️ Minor gap: No dedicated PDF download button (uses browser print dialog) — acceptable for beta

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF9. AI-use is disclosed and visible where relevant

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence**:
- **Capture**: `LearnerEvidenceSubmission.tsx` — Checkbox "I used AI assistance" + text field "explain what/how" → sets `aiDisclosureStatus` (learner-ai-verified / learner-ai-not-used) and `aiAssistanceDetails`
- **Portfolio display**: `LearnerPortfolioBrowser.tsx` — "AI assisted" badge rendered when `aiAssistanceUsed` is true
- **Passport display**: `LearnerPassportExport.tsx` — `aiLabel(claim.aiDisclosureStatus)` per capability claim → "AI used — verified", "AI used — not verified", "No AI signal"
- **Educator visibility**: Evidence records and portfolio items carry `aiDisclosureStatus` field viewable in review panels
- **Flutter parent view**: `parent_portfolio_page.dart` — `_formatAiDisclosure()` with human-readable labels
- **Audit trail**: Stored in Firestore `portfolioItems.aiDisclosureStatus`, copied to `capabilityGrowthEvents`, preserved in passport export

**Blocker**: None

---

### WF10. Family/student/teacher views are understandable and trustworthy

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL — Rich data exists via callables, but web dashboards are generic CRUD lists

**What's verified**:
- ✅ `getParentDashboardBundle` callable returns comprehensive evidence-backed data: `capabilitySnapshot`, `ideationPassport.claims[]`, `growthTimeline[]`, `portfolioSnapshot`, per-learner summaries
- ✅ `CapabilityGuidancePanel.tsx` exists and shows plain-language bands with progression descriptors + "no-evidence" state
- ✅ Flutter has custom dashboards: `LearnerTodayPage` (gradient progress cards, missions, AI coaching), `EducatorTodayPage` (class insights, quick stats), `ParentSummaryPage` (capability guidance, growth trends)
- ✅ `loadParentSummary()` calls `getParentDashboardBundle` and extracts: learner name, artifact count, reflections submitted, missions completed, capability band

**What's broken**:
- ❌ **G12: Three critical web dashboards are generic `WorkflowRoutePage` wrappers**, not custom UIs:
  - **`/learner/today`** — Shows enrolled session list (title/description/status). Learner CANNOT answer "what can I do now?" or "how am I growing?"
  - **`/educator/today`** — Shows session list filtered by `educatorIds`. Educator CANNOT see attendance, review queue, or learner context.
  - **`/parent/summary`** — Shows flattened learner list with artifact/reflection counts. Parent CANNOT answer "what can my child do now?" — the rich `CapabilityGuidancePanel` and capability band data from the callable is NOT rendered in the UI.
- All three routes delegate to `WorkflowRoutePage` which renders the identical generic CRUD list: title, subtitle, status badge, metadata key-value pairs.
- **The Flutter client has real dashboards for all three roles. The web client does not.**

**Blocker**: G12 — Custom web dashboards (see §BLOCKERS below)

## ACTIVE GOLD BLOCKERS

### G9. No checkpoint mapping admin UI in CapabilityFrameworkEditor
- **Status**: 🔴 OPEN
- **Severity**: GOLD BLOCKER (WF1)
- **Location**: `src/components/capabilities/CapabilityFrameworkEditor.tsx`
- **Problem**: `unitMappings` maps capabilities to missions (units), but there is no UI to map capabilities to checkpoints. The gold spec says "map capabilities to units/checkpoints." The `checkpointMappings` concept exists in the backend (`functions/src/index.ts: checkpointMappingsFromUnknown()`) but only as data that flows FROM evidence, not FROM admin authoring.
- **Impact**: Admin cannot define "this capability is assessed at these checkpoints" — the capability→checkpoint graph is implicit, not authored.
- **Fix**: Add a "Checkpoint Mappings" section to the capability form in `CapabilityFrameworkEditor` that allows HQ to define named checkpoints per capability (e.g., "Can explain concept", "Can apply independently", "Can teach to peer"). Store as `checkpointMappings: Array<{label: string, description?: string}>` on the capability doc. Wire to evidence verification prompts.

### G10. No process domain model for rubric scoring
- **Status**: 🔴 OPEN
- **Severity**: GOLD BLOCKER (WF4)
- **Location**: Schema (`schema.ts`), `RubricReviewPanel.tsx`, `applyRubricToEvidence` callable
- **Problem**: The gold spec requires rubrics "tied to capabilities **and process domains**" (cross-cutting skills like collaboration, critical thinking, communication, persistence). Current model only scores capabilities. No `ProcessDomain` type, no domain field in `RubricTemplateCriterion`, no domain selector in UI, no domain growth tracking.
- **Impact**: Rubrics cannot differentiate between "student understands computational thinking" (capability) and "student collaborates effectively" (process domain). Only subject-area mastery is tracked.
- **Fix**:
  1. Add `ProcessDomain` type to `schema.ts` with `id`, `title`, `description`, `siteId`
  2. Add `processDomainId?: string` to `RubricTemplateCriterion` (criteria can point to EITHER a capability OR a process domain)
  3. Add process domain selection in rubric template authoring UI
  4. Add process domain scoring in `RubricReviewPanel`
  5. Extend `applyRubricToEvidence` callable to create growth events for process domain scores
  6. Display process domain progress alongside capabilities in passport and dashboards

### G11. Web `/learner/today` is a generic session list, not a growth dashboard
- **Status**: 🔴 OPEN
- **Severity**: GOLD BLOCKER (WF6 + WF10)
- **Location**: `app/[locale]/(protected)/learner/today/page.tsx`, `workflowData.ts:loadLearnerToday()`
- **Problem**: Route uses `WorkflowRoutePage` → `loadLearnerToday()` which queries enrollments → sessions → returns `WorkflowRecord[]` (title/subtitle/status). The learner cannot see capability growth, active missions, evidence submitted, or what they need to work on next. Flutter has a custom `LearnerTodayPage` with gradient progress cards, missions, AI coaching — web doesn't.
- **Impact**: Learner cannot answer "what can I do now?" or "how am I growing?" from the web. Violates WF6 ("capability growth updates visible") and WF10 ("student views understandable").
- **Fix**: Create `LearnerDashboardToday.tsx` component — replace `WorkflowRoutePage` on this route:
  - Show `CapabilityGuidancePanel` (pillar progress, capability bands, progression descriptors)
  - Show "Recent growth" (last 5 capability growth events with level + capability title)
  - Show "Active missions" (enrolled missions with completion status)
  - Show "Today's sessions" (today's session occurrences)
  - Load data via `getParentDashboardBundle` (already exists) or direct Firestore queries

### G12. Web `/educator/today` and `/parent/summary` are generic CRUD lists
- **Status**: 🔴 OPEN
- **Severity**: GOLD BLOCKER (WF10)
- **Location**: `app/[locale]/(protected)/educator/today/page.tsx`, `app/[locale]/(protected)/parent/summary/page.tsx`
- **Problem**:
  - **Educator today**: Shows sessions filtered by `educatorIds`. Cannot see attendance, review queue, learner progress context. "What needs my attention now?" unanswered.
  - **Parent summary**: `loadParentSummary()` calls `getParentDashboardBundle` and returns rich data, but flattens it into generic `WorkflowRecord[]` losing capability band detail, growth trends, and progression descriptors. "What can my child do now?" unanswered.
- **Fix — Educator**:
  - Create `EducatorDashboardToday.tsx` — replace `WorkflowRoutePage`:
    - "Today's sessions" (time, learner count, status)
    - "Review queue" (pending evidence count, pending PoL count)
    - "Class capability snapshot" (aggregate capability levels across learners)
    - Quick-link to evidence capture
- **Fix — Parent**:
  - Create `ParentSummaryDashboard.tsx` — replace `WorkflowRoutePage`:
    - Per-child `CapabilityGuidancePanel` (band, progress bars, next steps text)
    - Growth timeline (recent capability level changes with dates)
    - Portfolio highlights (latest verified artifacts with thumbnails)
    - Link to full passport export

---

## CLOSED GOLD BLOCKERS (Previously Fixed)

### G1. Reflections disconnected from portfolio items — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: `LearnerEvidenceSubmission.tsx` reflection handler now creates companion `PortfolioItem` with `source: 'reflection'` and `portfolioItemId` cross-link.

### G2. Checkpoint portfolio items missing `missionAttemptId` — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: Checkpoint handler captures `attemptRef.id` and writes `missionAttemptId` on the companion `PortfolioItem`.

### G3. Rubric templates authored but never consumed at apply time — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: `RubricReviewPanel.tsx` now loads published templates, shows selector dropdown, populates criteria scores, displays progression descriptors, passes `rubricId` to callable.

### G4. Overly permissive Firestore rules — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: Ownership checks on `presenceRecords`, `conversations`, `habitLogs`, `incidents`, `offlineDemoActions`, `drafts`.

### G5. No standalone learner portfolio browse view — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: `LearnerPortfolioBrowser.tsx` with source/verification/pillar filters, tabbed layout on `/learner/portfolio`.

### G6. `/educator/evidence` route no case body in workflowData.ts — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: Added case body querying `evidenceRecords` with site-scoping.

### G7. `drafts` collection no ownership check — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: Added `userId == auth.uid` checks on all CRUD operations.

### G8. CapabilityFrameworkEditor missing accessible names — ✅ CLOSED
- **Fix**: Added `aria-label` to 5 form elements.

## EXECUTION PLAN — PATH TO GOLD

**Priority order** (highest-impact blockers first):

### Phase 1: Custom Web Dashboards (G11 + G12)
These are the single biggest gap between the current state and gold. The backend data is already there — the callables and Firestore queries return rich, evidence-backed data. The web UI just flattens it into generic lists.

1. **G11: `/learner/today` custom dashboard**
   - Create `LearnerDashboardToday.tsx`
   - Sections: capability guidance panel (pillar progress + bands), recent growth events, active missions, today's sessions
   - Data: `getParentDashboardBundle` callable or direct Firestore queries for `capabilityMastery`, `capabilityGrowthEvents`, `enrollments`
   - Replace `WorkflowRoutePage` in `app/[locale]/(protected)/learner/today/page.tsx`

2. **G12a: `/educator/today` custom dashboard**
   - Create `EducatorDashboardToday.tsx`
   - Sections: today's sessions (time/learner count), review queue (pending evidence + PoL counts), class capability snapshot
   - Data: Firestore queries for `sessions`, `evidenceRecords` (where `rubricStatus == 'pending'`), `portfolioItems` (where `verificationStatus == 'pending'`)
   - Replace `WorkflowRoutePage` in `app/[locale]/(protected)/educator/today/page.tsx`

3. **G12b: `/parent/summary` custom dashboard**
   - Create `ParentSummaryDashboard.tsx`
   - Sections: per-child `CapabilityGuidancePanel`, growth timeline, portfolio highlights, link to passport
   - Data: `getParentDashboardBundle` callable (already used by `loadParentSummary()` — just stop flattening it)
   - Replace `WorkflowRoutePage` in `app/[locale]/(protected)/parent/summary/page.tsx`

### Phase 2: Process Domain Model (G10)
This is the deepest architectural gap. Requires schema + UI + backend changes.

4. **G10a: Schema** — Add `ProcessDomain` interface to `schema.ts`, add `processDomainId?: string` to `RubricTemplateCriterion`
5. **G10b: Admin UI** — Add process domain management tab to `CapabilityFrameworkEditor` or dedicated admin route
6. **G10c: Rubric review** — Add process domain scoring to `RubricReviewPanel.tsx`
7. **G10d: Backend** — Extend `applyRubricToEvidence` callable to track process domain growth events
8. **G10e: Display** — Show process domain progress in passport, portfolio, and dashboards

### Phase 3: Checkpoint Mapping (G9)
Lower risk — the evidence chain works without it, but admin completeness requires it.

9. **G9: Checkpoint mapping UI** — Add section to capability form for named checkpoints (label + description). Store as `checkpointMappings: Array<{label: string, description?: string}>` on capability doc.

### Phase 4: Verification
10. **E2E with emulators** — Full chain: create capability → create session → submit evidence → apply rubric → verify PoL → check mastery → generate passport
11. **Mobile viewport** — Test educator evidence capture + learner submission on mobile
12. **Re-audit all 10 workflows** — Verify each shows ✅

---

## WHAT DOES NOT NEED TO CHANGE FOR GOLD

These are verified and complete:
- Evidence capture (educator observations, learner artifacts/reflections/checkpoints)
- Rubric + PoL → growth engine (atomic batch writes, mastery upserts)
- Portfolio browser (filters, verification badges, AI disclosure)
- Passport export (evidence-backed claims, growth timeline, text/print export)
- AI disclosure chain (capture → portfolio → passport → all stakeholders)
- Firestore security (ownership checks, site-scoping, default-deny)
- 130+ Cloud Functions (all real, zero stubs)
- Flutter custom dashboards (learner/educator/parent — these are gold-ready on mobile)
- All tests green (web 183, functions 127, flutter 317+)
