# Platform Gold Readiness Final Signoff - May 2026

Verdict: **NO-GO for blanket platform gold**.

This signoff records the current evidence packet without converting bounded proof into a platform-wide gold claim. Scholesa has strong gold-candidate slices across the capability evidence chain, site ops proof, local operator release safety, and read-only Cloud Run release state, but the final operator cutover has not been executed and recorded.

Forward plan: `docs/PLATFORM_BLANKET_GOLD_ACHIEVEMENT_PLAN_MAY_2026.md` is the required step-by-step runbook for converting this NO-GO packet into a GO packet.

## Evidence Recorded

| Area | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence chain browser proof | `npx playwright test test/e2e/evidence-chain-cross-role.e2e.spec.ts` | Passed |
| Site ops browser proof | `npx playwright test test/e2e/workflow-routes.e2e.spec.ts --grep "site ops workflow"` | Passed |
| Source contracts | `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/evidence-chain-renderer-wiring.test.ts` | Passed, 191 tests |
| Local operator release safety | `bash ./scripts/operator_release_proof.sh` | Passed |
| Read-only Cloud Run release state | `bash ./scripts/cloud_run_release_state_probe.sh` | Passed |
| Native-channel release scope | Explicitly deferred from this blanket platform packet | Deferred |
| TypeScript and lint | `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` | Passed |

## Operator Proof Summary

- `/site/ops` can create and resolve a site-scoped operator event with refresh persistence and `site_ops.event_resolved` audit proof.
- Local compliance runtime smoke verifies `/` 200, `/health` 200, and unauthenticated `/compliance/status` 401.
- Local operator release proof verifies the cutover guide, no-traffic guards, compliance auth posture, and rollback rule without deploying.
- Read-only Cloud Run release state probe verifies `scholesa-web` and `empire-web` traffic remain pinned to prior serving revisions while rehearsal revisions exist, `scholesa-compliance` is serving its latest ready revision, and unauthenticated compliance edge access returns 403.

## Remaining NO-GO Conditions

- Live six-role operator browser cutover has not been executed and recorded.
- Current-worktree live compliance deploy proof has not been executed and recorded.

## Steps Required To Convert This Signoff To GO

1. Complete every phase in `docs/PLATFORM_BLANKET_GOLD_ACHIEVEMENT_PLAN_MAY_2026.md`.
2. Attach current-worktree no-traffic web, Flutter web, and compliance deploy evidence.
3. Attach six-role browser cutover evidence for HQ, site, educator, learner, guardian, and partner if partner is included.
4. Attach traffic promotion or rollback/traffic-pinning evidence for `scholesa-web`, `empire-web`, and `scholesa-compliance`.
5. Re-run the post-promotion smoke and source-contract gates.
6. Replace the NO-GO verdict with GO only for the included web/Cloud Run scope, preserving native-channel and partner deferrals unless separately proven.

## Explicit Deferrals

- Native-channel app-store release operations are deferred from this blanket platform packet. The validated mobile evidence-chain and Flutter web/Cloud Run slices remain gold-candidate evidence, but iOS, macOS, Android store distribution, signing, notarization, and app-store promotion are not included in this signoff.

## Boundary

This artifact supports a **gold-candidate** readiness packet for the proven slices above. It must not be used to describe Scholesa as blanket platform gold-ready until the remaining NO-GO conditions are closed with live operator evidence and any future native-channel inclusion is separately proven.
